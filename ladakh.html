   Ladakh, the land of jagged peaks and barren landscape is alluring and awe-inspiring. Hidden behind this harsh and forbidding fa√ßade is an ancient civilization and captivating people. Beyond the old frontiers lies the land of wilderness with its unaltered character and overwhelming natural beauty beckoning the more intense and adventurous of travelers. This awesome wildness and magic belongs to that great land of towering mountains and Buddhist simplicity-Ladakh.<br> <br>

The largest of the 10 provinces of Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh is bordered by the Karakoram chain of mountains in the north and the Himalayas in the south. With the great Indus flowing right through Ladakh, the province is divided into Leh, the capital, Nubra, Zanskar, lower Ladakh and Rupshu. The many distinctive features of Ladakh are its uplands, craggy, barren cliffs and plateaus. Governed by a climate that provides about 50mm of rainfall each year, Ladakh is cold and dry. One, therefore, will be faced with a long and bitter winter of frozen landscape but yet very beautiful, and a short, hot summer when the precious glaciers melt.<br> <br>
            
            Ladakh region witnesses summer season between the months of April and September and this is the best time to visit Ladakh. This is the time when Ladakh experiences sunny days and the temperature lies around 20 to 30 degree Celsius.  The views are lovely and clear, and the nights are very pleasant. In the summer months, the two road approaches to Ladakh, the Srinagar-Leh Highway and the Manali-Leh Highway get cleared of snow and become motorable. Ladakh is visited by tourists and trekkers alike during this time. Along with sightseeing, one can also partake in adventure activities.
